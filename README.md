# Visitor-Counter-and-Automatic-Light

### Required Component:
1.  Arduino Nano or Arduino UNO
2.  16 x 2 LCD Display
3.  potentiometer
4.  IR sensor x 2
5.  Jumper wire
6.  Power supply

## Instructions:
1.  Connect all component as given in Circuit Diagram.
2.  Use on box for component safety and attach that box at door.
3.  Connect power supply and enjoy.

## Work:
  1.  When person is going inside the room then IR sensor will give signal to Arduino Nano/UNO and it will increace counter by +1.When counter value is greater then 0 it will automatically turn on light.
  2.  When person is leaving the room then IR sensor will gove signal to the Arduino Nano/UNO and it will decrease counter by -1.When counter value is reached zero then light will turn off automatically.
